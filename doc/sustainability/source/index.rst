The Sustainability Dashboard provides service-level transparency on estimated power
consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions for workloads running on
T Cloud Public. Its primary objective is to empower customers to better understand, assess,
and manage the environmental footprint of their cloud usage using a consistent, documented,
and standards-aligned methodology.
The dashboard is based on a cloud service catalog modelling approach, meaning that
sustainability metrics are calculated per cloud service (e.g. compute, storage, network),
rather than using aggregated or purely financial proxies. This allows for improved accuracy,
comparability across services, and meaningful sustainability insights at workload level.
