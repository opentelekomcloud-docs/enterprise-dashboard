Alert Service API
===========================================

Alert service provides a RESTful API, which allows you to create, edit or delete alerts via API.

For instructions about dashboards, user handling, or data structure, please refer to the `User interface <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/enterprise-dashboard/alerting/userinterface/>`__

To use the API, you need to access the session token of your OAuth user.

You can create API Keys in your organization settings (Configuration API Keys) or via API. The tokens are valid for up
to 90 days per default. Please make sure that the token security level is set as “Admin” during creation.

You can access https://api-alertservice.otc-service.com/ to get started with different API endpoints as well.
The alerting documentation is accessible in OpenAPI 3.0 standard via on route “/api/docs”.
