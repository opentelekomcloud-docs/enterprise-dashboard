Alert Service
=============

OTC Alert Service is an additional service provided next to the Financial Dashboard.
It allows to create alarms to monitor spendings on Open Telekom Cloud. The service
utilizes the user management of MyWorkplace and can be accessed by users with the
role "Commercial Orderer" or "Financial Dashboard". Recipient of any configured alert
will always be the user who created it. In other words, you can always just set up
alerts for yourself.

Alert Service can be accessed by visiting the following URL:
