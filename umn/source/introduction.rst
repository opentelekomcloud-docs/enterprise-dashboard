Monitor Spendings on a Payer Level
----------------------------------

It will also allow you to monitor your spendings on a payer level.
This means that all costs for each of your tenants assigned to you as
a payer are visible within one Dashboard.


Visualization with Grafana
--------------------------

Grafana 9.0.4 is currently used to render the monitored data. Feel
free to check the documentation of Grafana as well, if you’re missing
certain functionalities within this user manual. Please check the

The product feature **API access** gives you access to all API
calls described in chapter “API”.

The product feature **Dashboard Self Service** gives you the option to
create “Admin” or “Editor” users, which are allowed to create
dashboards, widgets, alerts, or users by themselves. Some examples are
described in the Chapter “How to”.

The product feature **Multi-Tenant** gives you access to a global
dashboard, which aggregates all spendings across several tenants. This
allows you to manage your business on a bigger scale.

In a scenario like the above, it gets very hard for User A to compare
data from multiple tenants. Each of his tenants has only access to the
data of the own tenant. To compare data he needs a global dashboard,
which allows him to access and compare data of all tenants in one
organization. Also from a financial perspective, it’s recommended to
consume Enterprise Dashboard Large instead of multiple Enterprise
Dashboard Medium.

The product feature **Organizations Management** helps you to easily
manage access to your dashboards and data. It allows you to split your
payer account (see `chapter 2.4 <#Organizations>`__) into smaller
parts with separate global dashboards. This allows you to move certain
tenants into a new completely separated organization with new users,
user groups, and dashboards.

In a scenario like above, where User B is not allowed to access
certain tenants, you can separate those tenants and give User B access
to that organization and therefore access to the global dashboard.
