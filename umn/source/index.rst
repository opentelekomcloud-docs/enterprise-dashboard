Enterprise Dashboard Service overview
=====================================

Enterprise Dashboard is a web-based Dashboard that gives you access to
your billing data. It allows you to check your spendings for your used
Open Telekom Cloud infrastructure.

Enterprise Dashboard provides you dedicated views for specific tenants
and their cost drivers.

It will also allow you to monitor your spendings on a payer
level. This means that all costs for each of your tenants assigned to
you as a payer are visible within one Dashboard.

Grafana 7.3 is currently used. Check the documentation of Grafana as
well, if youâ€™re missing certain functionalities within this user
manual:
